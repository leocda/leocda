- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @leocda.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in pretty much everything related to Computer Science, but my passion is research and development in computer graphics and digital image processing.
- âœ¨ Iâ€™m currently developing version 2 of the low-level libraries of the Picture to People project.
